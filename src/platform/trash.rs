//! The system Trash, for file operations: macOS's through `NSFileManager`,
//! Windows' Recycle Bin through `IFileOperation`, and elsewhere the
//! freedesktop.org Trash, written here. Each fails closed: a file is in the
//! Trash, with a receipt naming where, or it is where it was. Where a volume
//! has no Trash the answer is [`TrashError::Unsupported`]; nothing is ever
//! deleted, or copied and deleted, instead.
//!
//! This is the trusted boundary the catalog's `Trash` seam documents: a
//! receipt says the system moved the file. The catalog still removes rows
//! only once the file is gone from its path as well.
