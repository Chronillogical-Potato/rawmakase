//! Rendering one correction on linear camera pixels (white-balanced as shot).
//!
//! Inside a soft ellipse every pixel moves towards a dark neutral, whatever its colour,
//! as Camera Raw's does: the pupil's brightness is taken from green and blue alone, so
//! the red cast leaves no trace, then Darken scales it. Pupil Size scales the ellipse.
//! The constants are fitted to Camera Raw 18.7 renders of synthetic pupils (see
//! docs/retouching.md).
