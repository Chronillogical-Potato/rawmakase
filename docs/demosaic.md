# Demosaicing

RAWmakase demosaics images itself (`crates/rawmakase-decode/src/demosaic.rs`) from the sensor data its own decoders unpack (`crates/rawmakase-raw`, see [RAW decoding](raw-decoding.md)). Black levels (including per-position patterns), white level and camera white balance are applied in RAWmakase. The colour pattern is the decoder's filter as a 48×48 tile, which covers Bayer and X-Trans periods.

Bayer uses two passes:

1. **Green** at red and blue sites, blending Hamilton–Adams horizontal and vertical estimates by inverse gradient, clamped to the neighbouring greens.
2. **Red and blue** from the difference to green of the nearest same-colour samples (radius 1, else 2), weighted by inverse distance.

X-Trans (`crates/rawmakase-decode/src/demosaic/xtrans.rs`) builds one full RGB candidate per direction (horizontal, vertical, both diagonals): green interpolated along that line between the nearest greens with a same-colour curvature correction, red and blue from their difference to that green between the nearest red or blue samples along the same line (up to five pixels away, the longest gap along an X-Trans row or column). Each pixel blends the four candidates by two measures: how smooth their R − G and B − G is in the surrounding 3×3, and how little luminance (the candidates' mean green) changes along their direction in the surrounding 5×5. The weight is ((smoothest ÷ own roughness) × (least change ÷ own change))⁴, so a wrong direction, which leaves a colour pattern or crosses the detail, gets little weight.

Why these measures:

- **Curvature 0.2.** The same-colour curvature correction of the directional green is kept small: at 0.5 it overshot on sharp edges and left a violet, stair-stepped fringe (X-S10).
- **No isotropic candidate.** A single isotropic estimate turned fine periodic detail such as louvres and grilles into green and magenta moiré (X100F DSCF8231, DSCF8232); LibRaw's Markesteijn did not. An isotropic candidate added to the four (#523) brought it back on fine meshes: its colour there is smooth but wrong, so it won the blend. It was removed, keeping #523's curvature and blend power, which are what fixed the X-S10 edge.
- **Luminance change and colour reach (#547).** Fine slats can leave smooth false colour in every candidate except the one along them, which the colour measure alone cannot distinguish from real colour. Directional luminance change helps select that candidate. The five-pixel red/blue reach covers the longest gaps along X-Trans rows and columns, avoiding an isotropic fallback across the detail.
- **Noise below black is clipped after interpolation, not before.** A dark area's noise reaches below the black level, and clipping it at zero raises the area's mean; the smaller the signal against the noise, the more. Synthetic dark patches with Gaussian noise (`scripts/corpus/probe_dng.py`'s `black_level` keeps the negative samples in the file) showed Camera Raw 18.7 raising such a patch 0.5 to 0.7 times as much as clipping each sample would, as if it clipped only after demosaicing, where an interpolated sample averages its neighbours' noise: for green exactly the mean of a native sample and a four-sample average. Development therefore keeps samples below black negative and the Bayer passes interpolate them unclipped; the result is clipped at zero once, per channel (the draft's 2 × 2 block sums too). The bias of a noisy patch at ten stops under white with noise twice its level fell from 1.67/1.37/1.52 (red/green/blue, as a multiple of the true level) to 1.54/1.31/1.38 against Camera Raw's 1.35/1.23/1.35, and an ISO 6400 night scene's near-black background lost most of its magenta cast (red and blue over green at Exposure +4: 2.36/1.28 before, 2.05/0.86 after, Camera Raw 1.70/0.68). What remains is the demosaic's own noise: red and blue interpolated from colour differences carry more of it than Camera Raw's. X-Trans still clips each sample before demosaicing.
- **Clipped highlights.** Within two pixels of a clipped sample (at the sensor's white, as development counts clipped samples; white balance scales it per colour) the blend leaves out luminance change and weighs by colour smoothness alone, as before #547: there colour differences are wrong, and on an X100F night shot of red neon tubes (clipped red, unclipped green) the candidate picked by luminance change put red too low between the tubes, which highlight recovery turned into green, jagged lines. Only that private photo shows it; synthetic tubes did not reproduce it.
- **Stripes too fine for any direction (`crates/rawmakase-decode/src/demosaic/stripes.rs`, #547).** Near a three-pixel period, red and blue can sample almost one phase of the slats over long stretches. Choosing a direction cannot recover that missing colour information. After blending, a Hann-windowed, zero-mean quadrature detector tests square-root luminance at 0.317 and 0.383 cycles per pixel over 12 taps. It first averages nine parallel lines to reject noise and crossing detail. Energy and variance are pooled over three grid lines across the period before calculating their ratio; suppression starts at a 25% share and is full at 45%. The detector runs on a four-pixel grid, with a three-by-three spread and bilinear interpolation of its strength.

  The replacement colour is **chromaticity**, `(R − G) / L` and `(B − G) / L`, with `L = (R + 2G + B) / 4`. Channel differences and luminance are summed within 4×4 blocks, then pooled over 25 grid points along the period using detection weights, before division. This reduces drifting bands without giving near-black noisy blocks the same colour vote as bright blocks.

  Each pixel keeps its luminance. A nearby reliable core of the same orientation promotes coverage at finite stripe edges, without adding support outside the detector or changing colour-estimation weights. Coverage is not an exact boundary mask: nearby similar-coloured flat surfaces can borrow the stripe mean past slat ends, including in noise. Negative channels are avoided by reducing chroma towards neutral. The mean excludes the outer 16 pixels, and band margins cover the full filtering footprint. Stored previews use development identity 2 to regenerate results made before these demosaic and lens-sampling changes.

  Built-in lens CA remapping can introduce colour again by sampling different slat brightnesses per channel. The renderer protects nearly constant reconstructed chromaticity on fine repeated detail in both CPU and GPU sampling; see [lens corrections](lens-corrections.md#reconstructed-x-trans-fine-detail).

  This estimates colour that the CFA cannot resolve; it does not recover a ground truth. Subtle real colour variation on detected fine stripes can be attenuated, and diagonal patterns or periods outside the detector's band are not covered. Colour changes along the slats are retained, but low-contrast colour across their period can be mistaken for moiré.

Directional distances are precomputed for the shared 144-row colour layout.

Bands of 144 rows with a mirrored margin keep the working set small.

Borders are mirrored, which keeps the Bayer colour parity. Half-size drafts are ⌈W/2⌉ × ⌈H/2⌉: on Bayer data each pixel is a 2 × 2 block's red, blue and mean green; other mosaics (X-Trans) are demosaiced in full and averaged over 2 × 2 blocks. Small RAWs and linear DNGs, which are not mosaics, develop at full size in both modes. Files that are neither (Foveon, four-colour filters) are not developed.

LibRaw's AHD and Markesteijn, once offered under Preferences > Performance, are no longer offered; a session that chose them reads as RAWmakase's demosaic.

The crop metrics compare three 800 px crops at 100% with Lightroom's X100F export and Camera Raw's A7 II render, allowing ±1 px alignment. Fine detail is the error of the image minus a 7 px box blur. Scorecards with the new default: X100F Lightroom references 0.0093 MAE, A7 II Camera Raw references 0.0063.
