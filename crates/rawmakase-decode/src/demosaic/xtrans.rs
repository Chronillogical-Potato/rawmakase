//! X-Trans demosaicing by directional candidates.
//!
//! X-Trans has no regular two-pixel greens, so one isotropic estimate turns fine
//! periodic detail (louvres, grilles, meshes) into colour moiré. Instead every
//! direction (horizontal, vertical and both diagonals) gets its own full RGB
//! candidate:
//!
//! 1. Green at red/blue sites by interpolating along the direction between the
//!    nearest greens, corrected by the same-colour curvature along that line.
//! 2. Red and blue from the difference to that direction's green, as on Bayer.
//! 3. Per pixel, the candidates are blended by how smooth their colour difference
//!    (R − G, B − G) is around it and how little the luminance changes along their
//!    direction. A correct direction leaves neutral detail neutral; a wrong one
//!    leaves a colour pattern, which scores badly. Detail runs along the correct
//!    direction, so luminance changes least along it; this decides where every
//!    candidate's colour is smooth, as on stripes too fine for the red and blue
//!    samples (X100F DSCF8231's tower).
//!
//! The image is processed in row bands with a mirrored margin so every window fits.
//! Stripes too fine for any direction to get their colour right then lose it
//! (`super::stripes`).
