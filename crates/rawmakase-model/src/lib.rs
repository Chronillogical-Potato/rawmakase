//! What a photo's edit is, as values: the recipe and the settings it is made of,
//! camera metadata and profiles, lens profiles, colour primitives and output pixel
//! buffers, with the file and storage helpers they need. It builds without LibRaw,
//! the renderer, wgpu or the desktop app, which the RAWmakase crate adds on top.
