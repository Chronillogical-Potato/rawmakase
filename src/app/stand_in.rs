//! The stored Standard preview Develop shows while a photo opens (issue #213),
//! until its first live render. It is only something to look at: nothing that
//! reads the photo (samples, the readout, white balance picking, the histogram,
//! tools, Before/After, export) ever reads it.
//!
//! Workers read the preview cache off the UI thread, decode the JPEG and
//! convert it through the monitor profile: one for the photo being opened and
//! one for its neighbour, so preparing the neighbour never replaces or holds up
//! the photo's own read. The last two neighbours prepared are kept, so moving
//! on can show one in the first frame.
