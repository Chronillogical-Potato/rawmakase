# Lightroom curve references

`lightroom-point-curves.json` contains numeric samples from **generated ramps**, not user photographs. The fixtures contain no private image data and no Adobe source code.

Reproduce inputs with `python scripts/make-curve-fixtures.py NEW_DIRECTORY` (numpy, Pillow, tifffile). There are seven 1024-pixel ramps, each repeated for 32 rows: neutral, single-channel ramps with other channels at 0.25, and paired-channel ramps with one channel fixed at 0.5. All inputs are 16-bit sRGB TIFF with embedded XMP settings.

Reference exports were made on 2026-09-26 with Lightroom Classic 15.5.1 in a disposable copied catalog, after **Read Metadata from Files**. Export: full-size 16-bit sRGB TIFF, no sharpening/watermark. Curve Refine Saturation is 100; all other adjustment controls are zero. No RAW demosaicing or camera profile is involved.

The JSON has 224 rows: sample the center of each strip (`y = 16, 48, …, 208`), then `x = 0, 32, …, 992`. Each row has five RGB16 triplets: Lightroom linear baseline, S master, independent RGB, clipped master, clipped/nonmonotonic RGB. Curve points are defined in the generator and the regression test. Using Lightroom's linear export as input isolates curve behavior from its small ICC round-trip error.

The Rust test checks both RGB cases over all strips and master curves on the neutral strip. Mean absolute RGB error is bounded to 0.0001 (0–1 scale); neutral master error to 0.00003. The looser peak bound accommodates dark clipped RGB values and ICC quantization. **This does not establish full parity:** saturated master-curve colors still differ (whole-ramp MAE 0.00240 for the S curve and 0.00333 for the clipped curve). Parametric curves and non-default Refine Saturation are not covered by these goldens. The latter remains reported as unsupported during XMP import.
