//! Lightroom's Red Eye Correction: an ellipse over a pupil whose colour is replaced by
//! a dark neutral, with Pupil Size and Darken sliders, or for Pet Eye by black with
//! an optional catchlight. Corrections are stored as
//! parameters beside the recipe, like spot removal, and render on the linear camera
//! image before Heal and Clone, so every later edit and export sees them.
//!
//! Positions are in image space (see [`crate::model::image_frame::ImageFrame`]); sizes are
//! fractions of the photo's long edge. The ellipse is Lightroom's: semi-axes along the
//! image's x and y and their correlation (`crs:RedEyeInfo`'s `width`, `height` and
//! `alpha`), not a rotation angle. The corrections themselves are
//! [`crate::model::red_eye`]'s.
