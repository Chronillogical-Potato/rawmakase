//! The edit a photo is developed with, worked out the same way wherever it is
//! needed: its saved RAWmakase edit, else its Lightroom edit, else the raw
//! defaults. Develop, Sync Settings and Export all start from here.
//!
//! The catalog reads the stored edit ([`Catalog::edit_record`](crate::catalog::Catalog::edit_record))
//! and [`resolve`] works it out after, so a caller can read many photos at once
//! and resolve them later, off the UI thread. Upright's analysis needs the
//! developed photo, so it is a step of its own: [`crate::develop::upright::complete`].
